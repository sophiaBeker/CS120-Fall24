# Instructions

Each sub-directory has an exercise for you to complete. Each exercise subdirectory is prefixed with the string `part-`. The subdirectory contains a README.md which explains the requirements for the exercise.

Start with `part-1` and move through the problems in numerical order. Only move on to the next part when you have completed the current part you are working on.

Every file that you submit must have a header. Please follow the [guidelines provided for this course](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17WkDlxO92zpb26pYM1NIACPcMWtCOlKO7WCrWC6YxRo/edit?usp=sharing).

Please adhere to the [Google C++ coding style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

When writing git log comments, please make them descriptive and meaningful. For example, "Fixed my typo that stopped it from compiling." or "Smashed the bug in my main function." are descriptive. Log comments such as "Done" or "upload" are of poor quality.

To build the program, use the `clang++` command. Use the BASH command shell to execute and test your programs.

# Rubric

Each exercise is worth 15 points. There is 1 part so there is a total of 15 points possible. Each program must compile before it is graded. _Submissions that do not compile shall be assigned a zero grade._

A detailed rubric is assigned to each lab in Canvas. The rubric in Canvas will specify points and criteria.

Generally, each lab part is assessed on at least two dimensions. A detailed rubric is assigned to each lab in Canvas. The descriptions below serve as a general reminder of how labs are assessed.

* Functionality (approximately 9 points): Your submission shall be assessed for the appropriate constructs and strategies to address the exercise. A program the passes the instructor's tests completely receives full marks for this dimension. A program that partially passes the instructors tests receives partial-marks. A program that fails the majority or all the tests receives no marks.

* Format & Readability (approximately 6 points): Your submission shall be assessed by checking whether your code passess the style and format check, as well as how well it follows the proper naming conventions, and internal documentation guidelines. Git log messages are an integral part of how readable your project is. _Failure to include a header forfeits all marks._
