# What to Do

1. Read the entire README with your partner before doing anything else.
1. If you haven't already, write `AUTHORS.md` in the parent directory. Follow the guidelines in the lab's root directory README.
1. With your partner, edit the `dffi.cc` source file using VS Code. Add the required header. Replace all the TODO comments with working code. Remember, make small changes and compile often.
1. Your program must use the functions defined in `dffi_functions.cc`. Do not change the prototype of this function (name, return type, argument types). Updated `dffi_functions.h` to have all the required prototypes. Read the TODOs for guidance.
1. Compile your program with the `make` shell command. Use the **debug compile error** procedure to debug any compile errors.
1. Run your program with the `./dffi` shell command.
1. Test that your program passes all of the test cases in the test suite above. If your program suffers a runtime error, use the **debug runtime error** procedure to debug the error. If your program does not produce the expected output, use the **debug logic error** procedure to debug the error.
1. Check your `AUTHORS.md` with the `make authors` shell command. Correct any errors.
1. Check for format errors with the `make format` shell command. Correct any errors.
1. Check for lint errors with the `make lint` shell command. Correct any errors.
1. Test your program against automated test with the `make test` command. Debug any runtime errors or logic errors using the same procedures.
1. After your program passes all of these tests and checks, push your code to GitHub. Use the usual trio of commands: `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`.
1. After you have pushed your code, you are done with this lab. You may ask your TA for permission to sign out and leave.

# Decimal Feet to Feet & Inches

When working with [US Customary Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_customary_units), one quickly realizes that they don't work well in decimal. Unlike the [International System of Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units), commonly referred to as the metric system, the US customary units are not base 10. Since they are not expressed in a base 10 counting system having 2.34 feet is really 2 feet 4 inches (2'4") and 3.6 feet is 3 feet 7 and 1/8 inches.

We are interested in doing a little arts & crafts at home and we've made measurements of a project that we're going to build out of wood. Using our handy dandy [TI calculator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Texas_Instruments_graphing_calculators), we've marked up our plans with very precise measurements out to seven decimal places!

Regrettably, our tape measure and ruler only go to eighths of inches or 0.125 inches. We need to write a program that can convert our measurements in decimal to feet, inches, and eighths of inches. ([What's the difference between a carpenter and a woodworker?](.answer.md))

The challenge here is that if you have a number like 123.45, how do you separate the fractional part (0.45) from the integer part (123)?

A very poor way to do this is to somehow truncate (cut) the decimal number 123.45 to just 123 and then subtract 123 from 123.45. For example, in C++ one may write something like this:

```C++
	double decimal_number{123.45};
	int integer_part{static_cast<int>(decimal_number)};
	double fractional_part{decimal_number - static_cast<double>(integer_part)};
```

Another way to achieve the same ends is to use the math library's [`trunc()`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/numeric/math/trunc) function to compute the nearest integer.

```C++
    double decimal_number{123.45};
    int integer_part{static_cast<int>(trunc(decimal_number))};
    double fractional_part{decimal_number - integer_part};
```

Neither of these approaches are fool proof. C++ integers can only represent numbers between -2,147,483,648 (-2.14 billion) and 2,147,483,647 (2.14 billion). C++ doubles can represent numbers between $2.22507 \times 10^{-308}$ and $1.79769 \times 10^{308}$. If we measured the distance from Earth to Mars, which is about 1.25 trillion feet, then we could never represent that number as an integer because 1.25 trillion is greater than 2.14 billion. In order to perform our conversion correctly, we must make sure the input double is not too large or too small to be truncated to an integer.

For CPSC 120, we will use the second approach where we use the `trunc()` function to first truncate the double and then use `static_cast<int>` to change the type from `double` to `int`.

Before you do the conversion, we need to check to make sure the `double` can be safely and accurately converted. If not, we will just [clamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clamping_(graphics)) the value to what can be represented by an `int`.

For example, let's say we have the following passage of code.

```C++
double big_number{4294967294.2147};
```

To check to see if we can convert the number, we can use `std::numeric_limits<int>::max()` and `std::numeric_limits<int>::min()` to find the largest and smallest C++ `int`. Since these numbers are `int` types, we must convert or _cast_ them to double types to compare the values. In the example below, `big_number` is clamped to the largest or smallest value possible or converted if it's in the safe range.

```C++
int converted_double{0};
if (big_number > static_cast<double>()std::numeric_limits<int>::max()) {
    // big_number is too larger to work with! We can either
    // exit or clamp the value to something we can work with.
    // In this example, we will clamp.
    big_number = static_cast<double>()std::numeric_limits<int>::max();
} else if (big_number < static_cast<double>()std::numeric_limits<int>::min()) {
    // big_number could be too small to work with! We can either
    // exit or clamp the value to something we can work with.
    // In this example, we will clamp.
    big_number = static_cast<double>()std::numeric_limits<int>::min();
} else {
    // It's not too big and it's not too small - we can convert it!
    // Truncate it first, then cast it, and assign it to an int.
    converted_double = static_cast<int>(trunc(big_number));
}
```

Remember the types must always match. Look at each line with an assignment operator ('='). Notice that the type on the left hand side matches the type on the right hand side. When we want to assign a floating point number like a `float` or `double` to an integer variable (of type `int`), then we can use the [`static_cast` operation](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/static_cast) to tell the compiler to treat something of one type as another type.

Going back to our earlier example:

```C++
    double decimal_number{123.45};
    int integer_part{static_cast<int>(trunc(decimal_number))};
    double fractional_part{decimal_number - integer_part};
```

If we want to figure out how many feet, inches, and eighths of inches there are in 123.45 feet, then we must separate the integer part, 12, from the decimal part, 0.45. The above code puts the integer part in the variable named `integer_part`. Next we can take the difference between the `decimal_number` and `integer_part` which will result in leaving behind the decimal number (0.45), which we'll call `fractional_part`.

Once you have the two parts separated, you can figure out how many inches there are because you know that there are 12 inches to every foot. Given our example, 12 inches × 0.45 is 5.4 inches. Again, we have to separate out the integer part from the fractional part to find out how many eighths of an inch there are. We know there are 8 eighths of an inch in every inch so 0.4 × 8 is 3.2 eighths of an inch.

Since our tape measure and ruler can't go any finer than an eighth of an inch, we can safely discard any remaining fractional portion.

Thus given our example of 123.45 feet, we can calculate that there are 123 feet, 5 and 3/8 inches.

## Requirements

Use the conversions of 12 inches to every foot and 8 eighth of an inch in every inch. Define these values as `constexpr double` variables.

Perform your calculations using floating point (`double` or `float`) and integer types (`int`) where needed. Use your judgement to know which is the correct type to use.

Do not mix and match `float` type with `double` type. Use only `float` or only `double`.

You shall use [cout](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/cout) to print messages to the terminal and you shall use [cin](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/cin) to read in values from the keyboard.

The program reads in one floating point value from the terminal, uses as many variables need to convert the floating point value into a feet, inches, and eights of inches. The program prints out a message summarizing the data and the resulting calculation.

The program must work reliably with positive and negative values. The output should be formatted to only display one negative sign should the resulting measurement be a negative value.

The starting code defines a series of `TODO` comments which you can use to formulate your plan and develop your program.

Write your program progressively. Compile your program often and check that you're making progress. Make sure your program behaves the way you expect.

The output of your program must match the output given in the section Example Output below.

To compile your program, you use the `make` command. A Makefile is provided for this exercise.

## Don't Forget

Please remember that:

- You need to follow the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
- Remove the `TODO` in the comments. For example change `// TODO: Using cin, read the number of feet` to `// Using cin, read the number of feet`. 

## Testing Your Code

Computers only ever do exactly what they are told, exactly the way they are told it, and never anything else. Testing is an important process to writing a program. You need to test for the program to behave correctly and test that the program behaves incorrectly in a predictable way.

As programmers we have to remember that there are a lot of ways that we can write the wrong program and only one to a few ways to write the correct program. We have to be aware of [cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) that we may exercise that lead us to believe we have correctly completed our program. That belief may be incorrect and our software may have errors. [Errors in software](https://www.wired.com/2005/11/historys-worst-software-bugs/) may lead to loss of [life](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/business/boeing-737-software-update.html), [property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariner_1), [reputation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_FDIV_bug), or [all of the above](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009%E2%80%9311_Toyota_vehicle_recalls).

### Test Strategy

Start simple, and work your way up. Good tests are specific, cover a broad range of fundamentally different possibilities, can identify issues quickly, easily, and directly, without need for much set up, and can almost be diagnosed by inspection if the code fails to execute the test correctly.

## Example Output

Please ensure your program's output is identical to the example below.

To build your program, use the `make` command. To build the program either type `make` or `make all`. If you make no changes to your source code, `make` will not do anything and say `make: Nothing to be done for 'default'.`

Please make sure the output from your program matches the output from the example given below.

```

## Test Cases
Test your program before moving on. For each of the test cases below,

1. Look at the test suite, and identify the first test case, its input, and expected output.
1. Run your program with `./dffi` .
1. Provide the program with the test case input.
1. If the program crashes, use the **debug runtime error** flowchart to debug the error.
1. Observe the program output and decide whether the actual output matches the expected output.
1. If the output **does not match**, declare that the program fails the test. Use the **debug logic error** flowchart to debug the error.
1. Otherwise (the output **does match**), repeat step 2 with the next test case.

If the program works correctly (meaning no runtime or logic errors) for every test case, declare that the program passes the test. You can move on to releasing your code for part 1.


| Test Case | Input      | Expected Output                               |
|-----------|------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 1         | 12.345     | `12.345 feet is 12 feet, 4 and 1/8 inches`    |
| 2         | 0.125      | `0.125 feet is 0 feet, 1 and 4/8 inches`      |
| 3         | 0.00125    | `0.00125 feet is 0 feet, 0 inches`            |
| 4         | -0.00125   | `-0.00125 feet is -0 feet, 0 inches`          |
| 5         | -13.567    | `-13.567 feet is -13 feet, 6 and 6/8 inches`  |
| 6         | 10         | `10 feet is 10 feet, 0 inches`                |

## Format Check

Use the `make format` command to check your programs formatting. Correctly formatting your source code is a requirement of the grading rubric.

If you make significant changes to your source file, test it again to confirm that it still passes the test suite. Sometimes a small change that looks benign can actually create a bug.

Below is an example of the output of `make format` when you have correctly formatted code.
```
$ make format

## Lint Check
Use the `make lint` command to check your program for lint. If you find that your program has lint, then take the necessary steps to correct your program so it is lint free. Lint free source code is a requirement of the grading rubric.

If you make significant changes to your source file, test it again to confirm that it still passes the test suite. Sometimes a small change that looks benign can actually create a bug.

Below is an example of the output of `make lint` when you have correctly formatted code.
```

## Push Your Code

After you have certified that your code passes the test suite and format check, release the code by pushing it to GitHub.

As usual, you need to
1. Use a computer that is authenticated to git. If your computer is not already authenticated, use the `gcf.sh` script in the **Git Configuration & Authentication* page in Canvas.
1. Add modified file(s) with the `git add` shell command.
1. Create a git commit with the `git commit -m "<MESSAGE>"` shell command.
1. Send the commit to GitHub.com with the `git push` shell command.
1. Refresh the web view of your repo and confirm that your push went through.

If any of these steps trigger an error message, use the **debug command error** flowchart to resolve the problem.

## Next Steps

After you have pushed your code, you are done with this lab. You may ask your TA for permission to sign out and leave.
